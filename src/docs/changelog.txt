1.3

- SCP5 Bugfixes

1.2

- Added a secondary method for keypads to enable themselves, based on finding their own keypad code within logs
	- This should add potential automatic support for FMs, but only if they don't do custom things with Keypad scripts.
	- Many FMs such as Ponterbee will still require custom patches to work fully.
	- Now, instead of a message in the top message box, the HUD String of the keypad will be updated.
