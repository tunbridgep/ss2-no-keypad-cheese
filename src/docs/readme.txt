System Shock 2 is a very exploitable game, with many areas containing valuable
goodies requiring keycodes. By knowing the codes upfront, many powerful items
can be accessed early and in some cases entire decksand major story elements
can be skipped entirely by knowing codes ahead of time. There are also several
areas where codes are not supposed to be known, and are designed to be hacked,
such as the Cryo Recovery closet in Med/Sci, which contains a valuable
BrawnBoost, code 00000.

Many mods have attempted to resolve these exploits by changing codes, however
this simply moves the problem - once the new codes are known, the game can be
exploited once again. This mod instead makes all keypad codes always fail -
including the correct code - until the player has gained the relevant log entry
or email outlining what the code is supposed to be.

Additionally, as a small quality of life improvement, a small message will
appear containing the code whenever the player uses a keypad they know the code
for. Many modern games such as Prey and the Deus Ex sequels do something similar.

Main Features:
- Compatible with SCP, SecMod and most other mods, including mods which change keypad codes
- Uses a generic solution to support all keypads from all FMs (with some caveats) [Thanks ZylonBane]
- All keypads require the player character to have obtained the code before it can be used
- Certain keypads with no relevant log or email outlining the code require hacking and cannot be exploited
- Codes are displayed when using a keypad with a known code
